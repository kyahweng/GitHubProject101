# GitHubProject101
This is my project on GitHub 101, we were asked to make a new repository and pull on our local computer and then edit it on our computer then push it on GitHub.

## Project

### Pull the repo from GitHub to local computer
> I did literally "git pull origin main" the repository from my GitHub - doesn't work. 
> I used "git clone (repo link)" instead and works.
### Edit the file on local computer
> First, I had to "cd GitHubProject101/" 
> Second, "explorer.exe README.md" to open the file on VScode and edit
### Push the file to github.com
> First, "git status" to see the changes
> Second, "git diff README.md" to see the difference
> Third, "git add README.md" to accept the changes
> Fourth, "git commit -m "Edited from local" to assign a commit name
> Fifth, "git log --oneline" to see the commit is ready to send
> Last, "git push origin main" to post the commit on GitHub.
